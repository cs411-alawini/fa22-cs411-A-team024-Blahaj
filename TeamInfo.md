## Project Summary

A major challenge in the healthcare industry is timely treatment of patients. Moreover, during the testing times of pandemic, receiving relevant observation and reservation of equipment becomes altogether laborious. Thus, giving rise to the utmost requirement of a system connecting patients, especially students, to hospitals, doctors and blood banks, thereby shortening the time taken between identification and treatment which would otherwise have been the difference between life and death.
The aim of this project is to minimize the time of delayed treatment of patients and improve functional performance, quality of life and survival.
